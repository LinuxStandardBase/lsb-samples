[FILES]

If the installation is LSB compliant, the \fB"/etc/lsb-release"\fR
file should contain the \fBLSB_VERSION\fR field.
The value of the field should be a colon separated list of
supported module versions indicating the LSB specification
modules to which the installation is compliant. If the installation is not
compliant, the above field should
.B not
be present.

Optional fields are \fBDISTRIB_ID\fR, \fBDISTRIB_RELEASE\fR,
\fBDISTRIB_CODENAME\fR, \fBDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION\fR and can be used to
override information which is parsed from the
\fB"/etc/os-release"\fR file. Since \fB"/etc/os-release"\fR is the new
standard, there is no need anymore to add any of the optional
fields to \fB"/etc/lsb-release"\fR.

If the \fB"/etc/lsb-release.d"\fR directory exists, it is
searched for filenames which are taken as additional module-version
strings to add to \fBLSB_VERSION\fR.

The required line style is:
.br
"\fIDistributor\fR \fBrelease\fR \fIx.x\fR \fB(\fR\fICodename\fR\fB)\fR"

Where \fIDistributor\fR can be a couple of words, but then concatenated
(i.e. Linux Foo BarLinux Linux -> FooBarLinux),
.br
\fIx.x\fR starts with a digit followed by any non-blank characters,
\fICodename\fR will also be concatenated (blanks cleanup only).

[EXAMPLES]
If the "\fB/etc/lsb-release\fR" file contains:

LSB_VERSION="core-2.0-ia64:core-2.0-noarch"
.br
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="I enjoy using my distrib"

and the "\fB/etc/lsb-release.d\fR" directory contains:

graphics-2.0-ia64    graphics-2.0-noarch

and the "\fB/etc/os-release\fP" file contains:

NAME="SLES"
.br
VERSION="12-SP2"
.br
VERSION_ID="12.2"
.br
PRETTY_NAME="SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2"
.br
ID="sles"


Then the results of various options will be:

.B $ ./lsb_release --all
.br
LSB Version:    core-2.0-ia64:core-2.0-noarch:graphics-2.0-ia64:graphics-2.0-noarch
.br
Distributor ID: SUSE
.br
Description:    I enjoy using my distrib
.br
Release:        12.2
.br
Codename:       n/a

.B $ ./lsb_release -a -s
.br
1.0 SUSE "I enjoy using my distrib" 12.2 n/a

If the "/etc/lsb-release" file is absent (indicating this is
not an LSB compliant distribution), the result will be:

.B $ ./lsb_release -a
.br
LSB Version:    n/a
.br
Distributor ID: SUSE
.br
Description:    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2
.br
Release:        12.2
.br
Codename:       n/a

Please include a complete, self-contained example that will allow the
bug to be reproduced, and say which version of lsb_release you are using.
